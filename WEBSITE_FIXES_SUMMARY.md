### 4. Blog Issues

#### Problem: 500 Server Error on blog pages
**Status: ✅ FIXED**

**Issue**: Blog pages were throwing 500 errors due to lack of error handling.

**Solution Applied**:

**Files Modified**:
- `ardurHealthcare/app/resources/routes.py` (lines 20-32, 38-50)

### 5. State Page Issues

#### Problem: Contact number inconsistency
**Status: ✅ FIXED**

**Issue**: State pages showed different phone number `(214) 800-6161` vs contact page `+1 (702) 809-2713`.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated state page template to use consistent phone number
- Changed from `(214) 800-6161` to `+1 (702) 809-2713` to match contact page

**Files Modified**:
- `ardurHealthcare/app/ourreach/templates/outreach/state_page.html` (line 632)

#### Problem: Content mismatch on specialty pages
**Status: ⚠️ IDENTIFIED**

**Issue**: Specialty pages use fallback content when specific data isn't available, causing content mismatches.

**Note**: This is due to the fallback system in specialty routes that generates basic content for specialties not in JSON data. This is working as designed but may need content review for consistency.

- Improved logging for better debugging
- Added fallback content for missing data scenarios
