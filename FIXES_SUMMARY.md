# Complete Fixes Summary - Ardur Healthcare Website

## Issues Fixed - January 24, 2025

### 1. ✅ Contact Form Redirect Loop (302 Errors)
**Problem**: Infinite redirect loop when accessing `/contact-us`
- Multiple requests showing: `127.0.0.1 - - [24/Jul/2025 17:26:06] "GET /contact-us HTTP/1.1" 302 -`

**Root Cause**: Conflicting route definitions in `main/routes.py` and `contact/routes.py`

**Solution**:
- Removed duplicate `/contact-us` routes from `app/main/routes.py` (lines 33-39)
- Kept only the primary route in `app/contact/routes.py`
- **Result**: Contact form now loads without redirect loops

### 2. ✅ Service URL Structure Fixes
**Problem**: URLs using underscores instead of SEO-friendly hyphens
- Old: `/services/eligibility_verification`
- Expected: `/services/eligibility-and-benefits-verification`

**Solution**:
Updated `app/services/routes.py`:
- Modified `service_detail()` function to convert hyphens to underscores for JSON lookup
- Updated all redirect routes to use proper hyphenated URLs
- Added proper URL mapping for all services:
  - `eligibility-and-benefits-verification`
  - `prior-authorization-services`
  - `provider-credentialing-and-enrollment`
  - `charge-entry-services`
  - `medical-coding-services`
  - `claim-submission-and-follow-up-services`
  - `payment-posting-and-reconciliation`
  - `denial-management-services`
  - `accounts-receivable-management`

### 3. ✅ Dynamic Specialty Search in Contact Form
**Problem**: Static specialty field with no search functionality

**Solution**:
- Added API endpoint: `/api/specialties` in `contact/routes.py`
- Implemented dynamic autocomplete search with JavaScript

  - Real-time search filtering
  - Multiple specialty selection with tags
  - Custom specialty input option
  - Proper form validation

  - Service Type dropdown

### 5. ✅ Missing Static Files
**Problem**: 404 errors for missing images
- `/static/images/usa-map.png`

  - Simplified US state outlines

  - Professional healthcare branding
  - Coverage area legend
- Replaced abstract background with CSS gradient

- `/coding` → `/services/medical-coding-services`
- `/claims` → `/services/claim-submission-and-follow-up-services`
