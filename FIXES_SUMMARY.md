# Fixes Summary - Ardur Healthcare Website Issues

## Date: January 25, 2025

### Issues Reported and Fixed:

## 1. ✅ 404 Service Route Errors
**Problem:** Missing service routes causing 404 errors:
- `/services/accounts-receivable-management` 
- `/services/payment-posting-and-reconciliation`

**Solution:** Added missing route handlers in `app/services/routes.py`:
```python
@services.route('/accounts-receivable-management')
def accounts_receivable_management():
    return redirect(url_for('services.service_detail', service_name='accounts-receivable-management-services'))

@services.route('/payment-posting-and-reconciliation')
def payment_posting_and_reconciliation():
    return redirect(url_for('services.service_detail', service_name='payment-posting-and-reconciliation-services'))
```

## 2. ✅ Blog Post Template Error Fixed
**Problem:** `jinja2.exceptions.UndefinedError: 'dict object' has no attribute 'content'`
- Blog routes were creating simplified post objects without the proper content structure
- Template expected `post.content.introduction` but post was a simple dict

**Solution:** Updated all specific blog routes in `app/resources/routes.py` to use actual blog data:
- Changed from hardcoded post dictionaries to using `get_blog_post(slug)` function
- Now properly retrieves structured blog data from `blog_data.py`
- Includes proper content sections, introduction, and metadata

**Routes Fixed:**
- `/resources/blog/what-is-medical-billing`
- `/resources/blog/medical-coding-vs-billing`
- `/resources/blog/medical-billing-denial-reasons`
- `/resources/blog/cpt-icd10-hcpcs-codes`
- `/resources/blog/medical-billing-process-overview`

## 3. ✅ Contact Page Address Updated
**Problem:** Placeholder address needed to be updated to actual Las Vegas location

**Solution:** Updated in `app/contact/templates/contact_form.html`:
```html
<!-- Before -->
123 Healthcare Drive, Suite 456
Anytown, CA 90210, USA

<!-- After -->
1964 Heritage Oaks St
Las Vegas, NV 89119, United States
```
- Also updated Google Maps link to point to correct address

## 4. ✅ Contact Specialty Field Verification
**Status:** Specialty autocomplete functionality is working correctly
- API endpoint `/api/specialties` is properly registered and functional
- JavaScript handles real-time suggestions and multi-select functionality
- Features include:
  - Real-time search filtering
  - Tag-based selection display
  - Custom specialty addition
  - Form validation
  - Keyboard accessibility

## 5. ✅ Navigation Dropdown Improvements
**Problem:** Dropdown menus needed smoother transitions and better hover stability

**Solutions Implemented:**

### Enhanced CSS Transitions:
- Increased transition duration from 0.2s to 0.3s for smoother animations
- Added transition delays to prevent flickering
- Added hover bridge to prevent dropdown from disappearing when moving mouse between trigger and menu

### JavaScript Enhancements:
- Added comprehensive dropdown management with timeouts
- Implemented 150ms delay before hiding dropdowns
- Added proper keyboard accessibility
- Click-outside-to-close functionality
- Stable hover states with proper event handling

### Key Improvements:
```css
.desktop-dropdown .dropdown-menu {
    transition: opacity 0.3s ease, transform 0.3s ease, visibility 0.3s ease;
    transition-delay: 0s, 0s, 0.15s;
}

.desktop-dropdown::before {
    /* Invisible bridge between trigger and dropdown */
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 100%;
    height: 10px;
}
```

## Verification Status:

- ✅ Blog posts render without template errors
- ✅ Contact page shows correct Las Vegas address
